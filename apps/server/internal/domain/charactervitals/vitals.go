// This file makes the character's absolute MaxHP/MaxMP DERIVED values:
//
//	MaxHP = trunc( 1.02^(level-1) * STR * 10 )
//	MaxMP = trunc( 1.02^(level-1) * INT * 10 )
//
// ADOPTION EVIDENCE:
// two DISJOINT derivations agree on this closed form - the community
// derived it empirically from live retail of exactly our era (S13/S14:
// nivlam-era emulator scene, 2008/09), and LANE-3 read the same structure
// out of the cross-version GameServer binary (ParamKeeper seeded with
// level/STR/INT and a 1.02^(level-1) scale, lane3 notes section F) without
// ever seeing the closed form. Period observations reproduce it to the
// digit, and the vendor _AddNewChar SQL creates characters at STR/INT
// 20/20 with HP/MP 200/200 - the formula at level 1. Confidence for
// v1.150: HIGH.
//
// It is trunc, NOT round - the retail worked examples depend on it
// (1.02^42 * 173 * 10 = 3974.23... -> 3974). Retail computed this in
// server-side double arithmetic (the formula never shipped in a table and
// the v1.150 client provably never computes a maximum), so float64 pow +
// Trunc here is the faithful reproduction, not an approximation.
//
// AUTHORITY: the derivation is the ONLY source of the maxima this server
// emits - the 0x343C block, the vitals/char-data current-HP clamps, the
// enter-world snapshot and the agent API all call these helpers. The
// persisted maxHp/maxMp record fields are NON-authoritative history: they
// are deliberately neither consulted nor rewritten (rewriting stored data
// on a rule change would destroy the import record; deriving at read
// leaves exactly one source of truth, which was lane3's objection to any
// half-measure).
//
// ONE OWNER. The stored current is a plain number. The living maximum is
// stat-graph param 3 (HP) and param 4 (MP), which include item options and
// abnormal factors. This package cannot see that graph.
//
// CurrentHP/CurrentMP no longer clamp a stored value down to the closed
// form. A negative stored value becomes 0. Death remains a stored 0.
// An absent current still means "full", but only the gameplay helper
// (action.Runtime.playerKeeperVitals) knows full-of-which-maximum. Readers
// that cannot reach the stat graph — the character store's life check,
// the mentor notice, and the party register — treat an absent current as
// full at this closed form, and a stored number as that number. They must
// not be used to apply damage, cost, or a HUD gauge. When a maximum drops,
// the gameplay owner writes the clamped current back, so those readers
// then show the new value.
//
// LEVEL-UP STAT GROWTH - IMPLEMENTED (levelup wave, LANE-1): the adopted
// package's other half is "+1 STR and +1 INT automatically per level,
// plus +3 free stat points" (5 per level: 2 auto, 3 manual). It is proven
// arithmetically by the retail observations (a fresh character reaching
// level 2 with no points spent shows 214 HP = trunc(1.02 * 21 * 10) -
// only STR 21 produces that, so the auto +1 is real). The level-up path
// that was deliberately absent through the adopt wave now exists:
// progression.Runtime.GrantExperience (internal/game/progression/levelup.go) walks the
// leveldata exp curve (column 1, the same sub_7e0f20 row the client's
// own 0x30D2 walk reads) and, per level gained, performs exactly the
// 3-step contract this comment used to hold open:
//
//  1. raise Strength AND Intellect by 1 (through clampStatWord);
//  2. grant +3 StatPoints (progression.StatPointsPerLevel);
//  3. re-emit BuildLoginStatBlock (0x343C) - the maxima then move
//     automatically because they are derived, and current HP/MP stays
//     put per the LEAVE policy above.
//
// The authority core is trigger-agnostic. Live monster kills and quests feed
// it through progression.ExperienceUpdater; monster deaths may walk level down
// through the signed-delta half without revoking all-time earned stats.
