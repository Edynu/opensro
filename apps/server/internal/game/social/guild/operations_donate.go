// GpDonateOutcome is one handled 0x740F request. AckPayload is the

// second-host guide line); GuildGpPushPayload is the 0x3B29 subOp-5
// &0x08 guild-GP delta and DonorGpPushPayload the subOp-6 &0x08
// donated-GP delta, both for every ONLINE member named in MemberNames -
// the FULL member list INCLUDING the actor (both deltas are silent data
// writes on the client and the ack carries no state, so excluding the
// donor would leave their own pane stale - the notice-edit inclusion
// rationale, DECISION). EVERY refusal stays fully wire-silent -
// deliberately no ErrorPayload slot: the client's 0xB40F result-2 arm
// exists (sub_766ad0 @0x00766b8e -> cat 0x10), but no donate
// trigger->code pair is pinned in the v1.150 dump or the v1.188 server
// dump (the recon chased the GP_Donation schema column only), so
// emitting a code would invent the pairing (errors.go posture; the
// insufficient-SP guard is client-LOCAL - the edit seeds against
// CICPlayer+0x838 and UIIT_MSG_GUILD_ERROR_GP_SUBSCRIPION_SP has no
// pinned wire carrier).

// NO permission-mask bit and NO grade gate, so any member may donate.

// resource last; EVIDENCE(v1.188, logic) - the 0x4c0c gold-deficit
// family checks resources after resolving both parties): the amount
// floor (>= 1), the SP sufficiency and the u32 wrap guards all
// re-validate INSIDE the door under the store lock.
