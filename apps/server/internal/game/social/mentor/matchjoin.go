// The mentor-match JOIN seam: internal/game/social/match's owner-approval handshake
// (0x7592 -> kind-0xe owner prompt -> 0x35D5 answer) ends in a CAMP
// MEMBERSHIP change, and camps belong to THIS lane - so match reaches
// the two methods below through wiring.go func fields (the party lane's
// MemberCountFor posture; internal/game/social/match never imports internal/game/social/mentor).
//
// This file is the match lane's ONE seam into the relationship commit:
// it holds NO state of its own, runs the SAME atomic AdmitStudent
// door and the SAME 0x3AC5 fan-out helpers as the 0x76B1
// invite consent (invite.go ApplyConsent is the canonical shape - the
// commit below deliberately mirrors its accept tail over the shared
// primitives instead of introducing a second camp mutator). The
// direction differs only in WHO initiates: 0x76B1 is master->student,
// the match join is student->master with the master's 0x35D5 approval
// standing where the 0x3393 {01 01} consent stood.
//
// DECISION (listing-kind mapping): the joiner commits as a kind-2
// STUDENT. The mentor-match register form's kind combo (Student /
// AssistantGuardian / ALL, window OnCreate @0x6730bf..0x673141) is not
// pinned to a member-kind byte in either dump, and the join button's
// own gate (sub_671a50 @0x671aa7: level < 0x3c) admits both bands - the
// student band is the only one with a pinned level ceiling
// (StudentMaxLevel), so it is the honest commit until the kind byte's
// semantics are pinned.
