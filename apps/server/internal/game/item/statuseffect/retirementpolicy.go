// RetirementSelected is the selection predicate at 59FFD3..5A0025. The byte
// at descriptor+65 is tested for nonzero, not equality to a named activity.
// This is distinct from voluntary nbuf protection and duration persistence.
// Selection alone does not implement event 6, unregistering, or destruction.
