// TestHeadingCodecsAgreeWithinOneWireUnit is the single-source-of-truth guard
// for the two rad -> heading-word codecs this package holds, and it is the test
// headingWordFromDelta's own comment points at.
//
// WHY THERE ARE STILL TWO. HeadingWordFromRadians (moverequest.go) TRUNCATES
// toward zero because it replicates the CLIENT's 0x7738 request serializer,
// sub_877cc0 @0x877ceb, where the x87 rounding control is forced to truncate;
// that pin covers the C->S direction only. headingWordFromDelta ROUNDS, which is
// what the parity oracle and the human-verified BUG-11 fix already emit on the
// S->C side. How the retail SERVER converted radians into the S->C heading word
// is UNPINNED - there is no native server artifact - so neither form can claim
// the other's evidence, and switching would rewrite player-plane wire bytes for
// no evidenced gain.
//
// What CAN be asserted is that the disagreement stays inside one word unit
// (1/65535 of a circle, 0.0055 degrees - below the resolution of the client's
// own float32 parse, RadiansFromHeadingWord). Provably the bound is exactly 1:
// the rad->deg constant 57.295780181884766 (qword @0xc13df8) sits a hair above
// the exact 180/pi, so the truncating form evaluates trunc(v*(1+1.17e-8)) where
// the rounding form evaluates round(v); those differ by 1 whenever the
// fractional part reaches 0.5 and by 0 otherwise. So this is NOT a loose
// tolerance hiding a defect - a delta of 2 would mean one of the two codecs
// genuinely changed, and that is what this catches.
