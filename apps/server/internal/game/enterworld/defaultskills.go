// The character-creation skill seed: the racial base attacks retail grants
// at creation.
//
// MECHANISM (lane6 notes section 3, adopt-wave): retail seeds a fresh
// character's learned-skill list in the _AddNewChar stored procedure from
// the _RefCharDefault_Skill table (vendor SQL, Korean comments intact),
// selecting rows WHERE Race = the character's country OR Race = 3 (both).
// The v1.150 client never self-grants and tolerates an empty list (lane4
// notes), but retail characters never HAD an empty list - auto-attack
// availability on a fresh retail character never depended on a manual
// 0-SP learn.
//
// THE LISTS ARE CODENAMES, NEVER NUMERIC IDS - this is load-bearing, not
// style. The published 1.188 _RefCharDefault_Skill ids resolve in OUR
// v1.150 skilldata to chain SUB-rows (8419/8420 - rows the learn plane
// refuses by design), wrong-kind rows, TSKILL_* test rows, and one id
// that does not exist at all (lane6 3.2, the version-contamination
// catch). The EU id space shifted between 1.150 and 1.188; codenames are
// the version-stable key. The 13 rows below are the v1.150-native
// equivalent set (lane6 3.3): every non-TSKILL *_BASE_01 weapon base plus
// SKILL_PUNCH_01, verified against the shipped table to be level 1 /
// SP 0 / single-row groups that no chain link targets.
//
// Resolution happens at load time against the SHIPPED skilldata and FAILS
// LOUD when a codename does not resolve or resolves to a row that is not
// a level-1 / 0-SP ladder root: a refusal is recoverable, a silently
// short (or garbage) seed persisted into character records is not.

// chDefaultSkillCodenames is the Chinese creation seed: punch plus the
// three CH weapon bases (1.188 Race-0 rows + the shared Race-3 punch).
