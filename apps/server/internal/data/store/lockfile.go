// LockFileName sits in the authority directory while a process owns the
// store. The guard is TWO layers deep:
//
//   - an OS advisory lock on the file (flock on Unix, LockFileEx on
//     Windows - lockfile_other.go / lockfile_windows.go), held for the
//     owner's whole lifetime and released by the OS on ANY death, clean
//     or killed. This is the authoritative gate: it is taken BEFORE the
//     pid payload is read or written, so two racing openers serialize on
//     it instead of both passing a read-then-write window.
//   - a JSON pid payload inside the file, inspectable like every other
//     state artifact. It is operator diagnostics AND the guard against
//     writers that hold no OS lock (a hand-written lock, an older
//     binary): a payload naming a LIVE foreign pid refuses even when the
//     OS lock was grantable.
//
// The kill model still holds: kills release the OS lock automatically and
// leave only the stale payload, which the next boot replaces with a
// warning. The migration tool takes the same lock and refuses to --commit
// while the server runs (the dual-writer guard).

claimAuthority

claimAuthority is Open's single-writer gate. First claim of a directory

Callers that model a restart (the door-persistence suites) Close the
first instance before opening the second, exactly like a real reboot.

The returned release function must be called exactly once per successful
claim (Store.Close does); releasing drops the OS lock.

==================
acquireLock

acquireLock takes the OS advisory lock on path, refuses when another
LIVE process holds the directory, and (over)writes the payload with our
pid otherwise. Returns the locked handle (the caller holds it for the
store's lifetime) and a warning string for the stale-lock case (empty =
clean acquire).

The OS lock comes FIRST: the old read-check-write sequence had a TOCTOU
window where two processes both read a stale payload, both judged it
dead, and both wrote their own. Serializing on the OS lock closes it,
and the OS releasing the lock at process death is what keeps the
stale-lock-from-a-dead-owner reclaim working with no operator hand.

A pid can be recycled within milliseconds of a process exit, which would read as a
"live owner" and crash-loop the reboot until an operator deletes the
lock. The lock carries its write instant, so a candidate whose
CREATION time is after that instant is provably not the owner - the
lock is stale no matter how alive the pid is.
